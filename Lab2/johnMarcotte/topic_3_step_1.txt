To draw the square, I start by moving the turtle to a corner of the window using command (1) below.

(1) ros2 topic pub --once /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}"

I then clear the window using command (2).

(2) ros2 service call /clear std_srvs/srv/Empty

The pen color is then set to black using using command (3). 

(3) ros2 service call /turtle1/set_pen turtlesim/srv/SetPen "{r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, 'width': 10, 'off': 0}"

To draw the square, I used a series of absolute rotations, using command 4, with commanded velocities between.
The robot was oriented to the cardinal directions using rotation angles of 0, 1.57, 3.14, and 4.71.

(4) ros2 action send_goal /turtle1/rotate_absolute turtlesim/action/RotateAbsolute "{theta: 4.71}"
