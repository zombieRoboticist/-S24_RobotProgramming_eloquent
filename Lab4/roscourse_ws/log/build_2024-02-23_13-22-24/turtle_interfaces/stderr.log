CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/yahboom/S24_RobotProgramming_eloquent/Lab4/roscourse_ws/build/turtle_interfaces/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/yahboom/S24_RobotProgramming_eloquent/Lab3/roscourse_ws/build/turtle_interfaces where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/yahboom/S24_RobotProgramming_eloquent/Lab4/roscourse_ws/src/turtle_interfaces/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/yahboom/S24_RobotProgramming_eloquent/Lab3/roscourse_ws/src/turtle_interfaces/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
